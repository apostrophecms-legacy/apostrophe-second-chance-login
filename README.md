# apostrophe-second-chance-login

If a user attempts to access a page that is a 404 for them, but would work for an admin, this module notes the URL in a cookie and redirects them to the login page. After successfully logging in, they are taken to the page.

## Installation

```
npm install --save apostrophe-second-chance-login
```

```javascript
  // in app.js, where you configure your modules...
  modules: {
    'apostrophe-second-change-login': {},
    // other modules, etc.
  }
```

That's all there is to it!

## Warnings

There is a chance the user will still get a 404 not found error, as their account might or might not have sufficient privileges. In this case we show them the usual "not found" page and do not disclose extra information they should not have.

This module adds a performance hit to all 404 not found errors, so use it thoughtfully.

## Limitations

Currently this module only understands pages. If the user gets a 404 due to permissions applied to a piece, this module currently cannot assist. A better implementation would probably carry out a complete request with an admin `req`, however this requires a more sophisticated fake `res` object than we have handy at the moment. And it also has an even greater performance overhead. So then again, maybe not.
